QuantaMetirx: 
The project envisioned to provide a Quantum Generated Signature which is based on the probabilistic nature of Quantum randomness.
Each Signature formed is based on the Measurement Collapse Theory.
The measrued state and the count is uniquely governed by the QRNG Generated rotaion angles for each qubit.
The Verification module re-runs the same circuit with the decoded set of angles and based on a tight threshold the Authenticity is Validated.
